Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. Every female within the pride is usually related.
The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”
A kitten will typically weigh about 3 ounces at birth.  The typical male housecat will weigh between  7 and 9 pounds, slightly less for female housecats.
The female cat reaches sexual maturity within 6 to 10 months; most veterinarians suggest spaying the female at 5 months, before her first heat period. The male cat usually reaches sexual maturity between 9 and 12 months.
Unlike humans, cats are usually lefties. Studies indicate that their left paw is typically their dominant paw.
Cats spend nearly 1/3 of their waking hours cleaning themselves.
