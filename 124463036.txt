Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. Every female within the pride is usually related.
The technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”
A kitten will typically weigh about 3 ounces at birth.  The typical male housecat will weigh between  7 and 9 pounds, slightly less for female housecats.
